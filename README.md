# Getting Started with CryptoView App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running application
In order to run this application: 
1. copy github repository in visual studio code,
2. open terminal and run in project folder
    ### `npm install` or `npm install --force` 
3. ### `npm start`
(Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.)


4. In order to get access to full project functionality you must have metamask wallet installed.
5. You can face some errors when refreshing pages too many times.
   
   That is caused because of free CoinGecko.com API provider,

   which allows a limited amount of

   REST request per a small period fo time.
   This error will be automatically reseted in about a couple of minutes, by refreshing the page.
